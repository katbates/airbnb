# Airbnb - a dashboard built in Tableau

## Overview
I designed and built a dashboard for prospective airbnb owners to help them to make decisions about appropriate pricing for their airbnb. I used a public dataset from kaggle which contains information from airbnb about room type, price and location. I cleaned the data in Tableau, including using regex to split a column and extract 'number of beds'. The dashboard allows users to filter by their type of airbnb: location, number of beds, length of stay and room type. The dashboard displays key summary statistics about similar properties and a map they can use to explore pricing of individual local airbnbs.
